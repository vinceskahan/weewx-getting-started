## How To Report A Problem

When posting to weewx-user with a problem report, please try to provide enough information for the users there to try to help you.

* what are you trying to do ?
* what did you change (and how) ?
* what do you expect to see or have happen ?
* what did you actually see or have happen ?

### Describe your system
* what is a brief description of your station model ?
* your host(s) platform and os ?
* your network configuration ?

### Provide diagnostic information
* what do your logs show after setting debug=1 from weewx startup through two archive periods
* what does `weectl diag` report ?

### Reminder
You need to help the reader understand your setup well enough to try to recreate your issue.  Sometimes (rarely) there 'are' bugs.  Generally the issues are known and are simple typos or misconfigurations.  Providing enough information for the reader to recreate the issue will speed up getting your issue resolved. Really.
